## üìù Notes

* The project is structured using **OOP principles** and **modular design**, so each file has a clear responsibility.
* The **UI folder** is separated to isolate display logic from game logic.
* Any new features (weapons, enemies, UI components) should follow this structure to maintain consistency.
